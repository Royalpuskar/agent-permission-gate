# Permission Gate

**Automation policy workbench · agent-permission-gate · working research prototype**

Evaluate typed automation capabilities with default-deny access.

## Problem and approach

Evaluate typed automation capabilities with default-deny access. This project makes the decision process inspectable through editable scenarios, explicit outputs and reproducible examples. It is an independent repository with a browser application and a Python reference implementation.

## Implemented features

Exact action/resource matching; expiry; explicit deny precedence; approval checks; decision explanations.

The responsive website runs locally in your browser, accepts editable JSON scenarios, includes preset cases, renders structured results, and exports a JSON report. It has no external runtime dependencies, analytics, external fonts, model API calls or API-key requirement.

## Run the website

Requires Python 3.10+ for the development server. From this directory:

```sh
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. Use **Run analysis** to evaluate the sample; change a scenario and run again. **Export report** downloads the current result. Serve over localhost or HTTPS so Web Crypto is available. Opening `index.html` directly as a file is not supported because the application uses JavaScript modules.

## Command-line usage

```sh
python engine.py sample.json
```

`sample.json` documents the accepted example shape; `expected.json` contains its expected output. `cases.json` adds fixed expected outcomes for boundary and normal cases.

## Tests

Python 3.10+ and Node.js 22+; no package installation:

```sh
python -m unittest -v
node test.mjs
```

The suites check explicit expected outcomes and input immutability. The JavaScript suite also checks malformed top-level inputs and reserved keys. Browser and Python results are compared against the same contract fixtures. Passing these cases is not a security certification or a claim of comprehensive coverage.

## Architecture

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `style.css` | Accessible responsive workbench |
| `app.mjs` | Scenario controls, safe DOM rendering, report export |
| `engine.mjs` | Browser-side algorithm |
| `engine.py` | Independent Python reference and CLI |
| `config.mjs` | Project identity and sample scenarios |
| `cases.json` | Explicit input/output contracts |

Flow: user edits a scenario → JSON parsing and bounded-input checks → project algorithm → text-only result rendering → optional user-triggered report download. There is no application server, account system or backend database.

## Security, privacy and limitations

Local policy evaluator, not an authentication server. Approval booleans are fixture inputs; a real deployment must obtain verified approvals from a trusted service.

Scenario data stays in browser memory. The app makes no analysis network requests and stores no inputs in local storage. A hosting provider can still receive ordinary page requests and access logs. Avoid entering real secrets or sensitive evidence; downloaded reports contain your input and results. HTML from scenarios is rendered as text, never executed. Limits cap browser inputs at 100 KB, 1,000 array elements and 15 nesting levels; these limits are prototype safeguards, not a complete denial-of-service defense.

## Development roadmap

- Expand adversarial and boundary fixtures before adding new capabilities.
- Add project-specific form controls alongside the advanced JSON editor.
- Measure performance with published datasets and reproducible methods.
- Conduct independent accessibility and security review.
- Document any integrations before introducing network calls or data retention.
